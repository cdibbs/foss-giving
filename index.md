## The bigger picture
Now, this author would humbly like to ask that you take a few minutes to give broader thought to your
open source contributions. If you haven't donated, yet, and wish to do that first, there will be a link
on the Thank You page back to the thoughts, below.

### The problem
How many open source projects have you come across that contain elegant and useful bits of software that
appear to have been abandoned by their authors before drawing a healthy community? Too many, I'll bet,
if you've spent much time working with open source. It's always heartbreaking to see, and you wish the
author would put up a donation page for encouragement.

By the way, if you are such an author, don't feel guilty - development takes a lot of time and energy, and
sometimes the currency of pure enjoyment runs out before it gets you through the doldrums that come with many
projects. So, please fork [this document's repo][repo], steal this page and its siblings, and set up your own
doldrum support page.

If nothing else, it's nice when the community buys you a beer or two. :-)

### What or who are you supporting?
When supporting open source software, its just as important to support individual developers as it is to support
projects you like. You can say, "I want this project to flourish," and "I want this developer to flourish." Both
have their place.

With all the time and effort it takes not only to develop quality software, but handle support, too, perhaps we
can help more talented developers afford to spend more time while still living a balanced life.

### For your consideration
Software such as [Mint] can help you track, categorise, and update your contributions. Perhaps your own bank
provides a similar functionality. Either way, could it be time to consider being more rigorous in your 
contribution budget? There are many projects and developers who would appreciate your support.

Thanks for your time!
