Thanks in advance for your support! If you want the author to know which project you appreciated,
a form is provided on the [thank you page](thank-you).

Note: the author of this site isn't running a non-profit. Contributions through this site
should be thought of like crowdfunding, giving a gift to a friend, or buying a software license
"on the honor system."

## The bigger picture
Now, this author would humbly like to ask that you take a few minutes to give broader thought to your
open source contributions--both you maintainers, and you who appreciate us enough to donate (thanks!). By the way,
if you haven't donated, yet, and wish to do that first, there will be a link to return here on the
Thank You page.

### The problem
How many open source projects have you come across that contain elegant and useful bits of software that
appear to have been abandoned by their authors? Too many, right?

If you are such an author, don't feel guilty - development takes a lot of time and energy, and
the psychology of sticking with it can be an uphill battle. Sometimes the currency of pure enjoyment
runs out before it gets you through the doldrums that come with most projects, and only a minority of
all projects have the potential to justify incorporating and ditching your day job. So, please fork
[this document's repo][repo], steal this page and its siblings, and set up your own doldrum support page.

If nothing else, it's nice when the community buys you a beer or two. :-)

### What or who are you supporting?
When financially supporting open source software, its just as important to support individual developers as it
is to support projects you like. You can say, "I want this project to flourish," and "I want this developer to
flourish." Both have their place.

With all the time and effort it takes not only to develop quality software, but handle support, too, perhaps we
can help more talented developers afford to spend more time developing quality open source while still living a balanced life.

### For your consideration
There are many projects and developers who would appreciate your support. What do you currently contribute to
open source, in general, each year? If you don't already know, software such as [Mint] can help you track,
categorise, and update your contributions. Perhaps your own bank provides a similar functionality. Either way,
could it be time to consider being more rigorous in your contribution budgeting methods?

Thanks for your consideration and time!
